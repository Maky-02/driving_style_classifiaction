# Driving Style Classification Using Sensor Data

This project classifies driving styles (e.g., aggressive, normal, cautious) based on sensor data such as speed, acceleration, steering angle, etc.

## 🚗 Features

- Preprocesses raw sensor data (CSV)
- Extracts relevant features
- Trains a classifier (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluates model performance
- Predicts driving style on new data

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 📊 Data

Sensor data includes:
- Speed
- Acceleration
- Brake force
- Steering angle
- GPS (optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
